# .vscode

This directory contains configuration for the Visual Studio Code editor. The
configuration might be handy for contributors using that editor.

This directory does *not* contain code for quick-lint-js's VS Code extension.
That code lives in the ../plugin/vscode/ directory.

* new-file.code-snippets: Templates for new files. To activate, either create
  a new document and click "fill with template", or choose "Snippets: Fill File
  with Snippet" from the command palette.
